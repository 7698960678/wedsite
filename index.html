                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>A postgraduate degree is a type of qualification that is completed after an undergraduate degree. Postgraduate degrees encompass a range of qualifications, including masters degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas and Certificates, and PhDs.

                    There are a lot of different aspects involved in postgraduate education. If you are considering expanding your knowledge with a postgraduate degree, it's important to understand the details.

    <h1>Our Global Campus</h1>
    <p>Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University,[13][14] is a private research university located in the census-designated place of Stanford, California, near the city of Palo Alto. The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[15] Stanford is ranked among the top universities in the world.[16][17][18][19][20]

        Stanford was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year.[2] Leland Stanford was a U.S. senator and former governor of California who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. The school admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after the death of Leland Stanford in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[21] Following World War II, provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley.[22]
        
        The university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 40 academic departments at the undergraduate level as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the public policy think tank, the Hoover Institution. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[23] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994–1995.[24] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[25]</p>

                <h3>World Class Library</h3>
                <p>A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

                    A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.</p>

                <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
                <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

                <h3>Tasty and Healthy</h3>
                <p>Here are some healthy canteen options and ideas. If they’re available at your school canteen, these are the options to go for.

                    Sandwiches, rolls and wraps
                    Encourage your child to choose a multigrain, wholemeal or high-fibre white sandwich, roll or wrap. Healthy fillings include salad and lean chicken or beef, fish, eggs or lentil patties.
                    
                    Cold food
                    Your canteen might serve fresh salads, sushi or rice paper rolls -yum!
                    
                    Hot food
                    Here are some healthy hot food options:
                    
                    fresh soups with wholemeal bread rolls on the side
                    pasta or lasagne with fresh tomato, bolognaise or vegetable-based sauce
                    lentil and vegetable hotpot
                    vegetable, chicken or beef curry with rice
                    rice or noodles with lean meat and vegetables.
                    Snacks
                    If your child wants to get a snack from the canteen, encourage him to choose options like these:
                    
                    fruit salads or whole fruit
                    reduced-fat yoghurt and fruit
                    air-popped popcorn (not cooked in oil)
                    reduced-fat cheese with pita or wholemeal crackers
                    vegetable sticks with dip
                    boiled eggs
                    raisin or fruit bread.
                    It's a good idea to pack a bottle with tap water for your child to drink and refill throughout the day. This is always healthier and cheaper than buying drinks from the canteen. But if your child wants to buy a drink at the canteen, encourage her to choose water or reduced-fat milk and soy drinks.</p>

<!-- -----TESTIMONIALS----- -->

<Section class="testimonials">
    <h1>What Our Student Says</h1>
    <p>Testimonials are important because they help you build credibility with future customers. Testimonials allow you to use your customers' words to show how your product or service solved a problem for them.

        Future customers respond to testimonials as more authentic than a company's statements about their own products, especially if there is a before-and-after image, a video or statistics to clearly show the results. Testimonials help your future customers see what your company can offer them through a marketing tactic that seems very similar to word of mouth.</p>
